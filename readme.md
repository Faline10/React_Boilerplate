# React Boilerplate
By: **Fawn Bertram**

## Installation:
* `npm install webpack -g`
* `npm install`

## Building:
* `npm run build` or just `webpack` to build. (Expect 3 errors for unused vars when you build this.)
* `npm run watch` to build just changes during development
* `npm test` - test suite not yet set up

## Technologies:
* React
* React-DOM
* Webpack - using CommonJS module system
* Babel
* ESLint
* JSX

A description of how to create this boilerplate from scratch and what the different parts do can be found in my blog: ["React in 10 Minutes"](http://example.com)
